# GOAL - generate spectrogram image of entire .WAV file
# expected input .wav files (upper or lower case extension) produced by the AudioMoth
# expected output .png files visualizing entire .WAV file

# iterate through all arguments
for file in $@
do

	# strip out the filename without path
	without_path="${file##*/}"
	
	# use conditionals to make wav extension case insensitive
	if [[ $without_path == *.wav ]] || [[ $without_path == *.WAV ]]; then
	
		# strip the extension
		without_extension="${without_path%.*}"
	
		total_duration=$(soxi -D "$without_path") # get the duration in seconds
		total_duration=${total_duration%.*} # convert to integer

		# generate the initial .png spectrogram output from sox
		# dimension here are for spectrogram only, extra padding will result in 1280 x 720 image
